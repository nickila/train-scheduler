# train-scheduler
This project was completed on November 3, 2018 for a coding boot camp course at the University of Minnesota by Brian Nickila.
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, Bootstrap and Firebase to create it.
Once user logs in or creates an account, the user may create a new train and give it all the required data.
The train then shows up in the table telling the viewer when the train can be expected to come to the station again.
